# BoilerMake 2021 - Queue21
## Inspiration
With the current situation, it is quite unsafe to wait in long lines. We thought creating an online queuing system for business would be a good idea...

## What it does
Queue21 lets people join queues for business and lets business owners create/manage queues...

## How we built it
We built it with HTML, CSS, and javascript...

## Challenges we ran into
We wanted to add a database to manage queues, but we were too unfamiliar with the situations...

## Accomplishments that we're proud of
We are proud of the addition and deletion to a specific queue...

## What's next for Queue21
Successfully add database for queues.
